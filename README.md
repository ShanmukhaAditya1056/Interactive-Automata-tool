# 🧠 Interactive Automata Teaching Tool

An educational web-based tool designed to simulate and visualize key models in Automata Theory:  
- **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**
- **Pushdown Automata (PDA)**
- **Turing Machines (TM)**

This tool is ideal for computer science students, educators, and anyone exploring the foundations of computation and formal languages.
